# figure-convert-reprex

A minimal reproducible example for converting a bunch of unique figure names
to the canonical form `figure_{num}` without repetitive code.

## Question

> Snakemake best practice question... I have 10 figures for the paper I am working on. I need to map the name of the figure to "figure_x" and convert from tiffs to pngs to embed into a PDF. Here's what I've got currently...

> ```python
> rule fig_1:
>   input:

>   output:

> Of course, this continues for 7 more figures. The downside of this approach is that there are 10 rules that are effectively the same. Alternatively, I could create one rule with 10 inputs, outputs, and lines in shell. The downside of the single rule is that if I want to update figure 3 then it constructs the dag for all of the outputs. Is there a better way that I'm missing?

## Solution

![dag](figures/dag.png)


The magic is in defining a dictionary that maps figure numbers to figure names:
```python
figures_dict = {1: 'figures/alpha_beta.tiff', 2: 'figures/false_pos.tiff'}
```

And using an input function to access the 
input figure name from the output figure number:
```python
rule convert_tiff_to_png:
    input:
        tiff=lambda wildcards: figures_dict[int(wildcards.fig_num)]
    output:
        png="submission/figure_{fig_num}.png"
    shell:
        """
        convert {input.tiff} {output.png}
        """
```
